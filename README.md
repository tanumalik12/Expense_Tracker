**What is an Expense Tracker?**


There are many people in India that live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month, they don't have sufficient money to meet their needs. While this issue can arise because of low salaries, it is due to poor money management skills. Expense Tracker, also known as Expense Manager and Money Manager, is a desktop application or software allowing users to record their money inflow and outflow accurately.

People tend to overspend without understanding, which can prove to be dreadful. We can keep track of our daily expenditures with the help of a daily expense tracker. By the end of the month, we will have a clear picture displaying the flow of money. This is among the best ways to get the expenses under management and bring some semblance of order to the finances.


We have divided the complete project code for creating the Expense Tracker in Python into several steps for better understanding. These steps are shown below:



Step 1: Importing the necessary modules.


Step 2: Creating the database and defining functions to manipulate the data.


Step 3: Connecting to the database and creating the main window of the application.


Step 4: Adding necessary widgets to the window and setting the event triggers.
